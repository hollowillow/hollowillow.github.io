		<h2> why make a website? </h2>
		<p> a personalised website goes a long way to distinguish yourself from others, while bringing all your posts and projects together, and being able to build a community around that. </p>
		<p> in the current internet landscape, it seems that everyone just has 20 profiles scattered across different social media platforms and in some part that is okay, but i believe it has taken away from that vibe and charm of the old internet, of everyone having their own little corner of the internet. </p> 
		<p> as this website develops i plan to turn it into a sort of hub for most of my online presence. i am planning to regularly blog regarding multiple of my favourite subjects (most likely a combination of tech, rpgs and music). If i figure out how to i would even love to publish some of my rpg work and so on. really i hope this will become a catch all for my creative projects. </p>
