## why make a website?
long story short, i've always wanted to have my own website.

in the current internet landscape,
i find that everyone just has 20 profiles scatted across different social media platforms
and in some part that is okay,
but i believe it has taken away from the that old internet vibe of everyone having their own corner of the internet.

a personalised website goes a long way to distinguish yourself from others,
while bringing all your posts and projects together, into a single curated space.
