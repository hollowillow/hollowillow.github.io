## why make a website?
a personalised website goes a long way to distinguish yourself from others,
while bringing all your posts and projects together, and being able to build a community around that.

in the current internet landscape,
it seems that everyone just has 20 profiles scattered across different social media platforms
and in some part that is okay,
but i believe it has taken away from that vibe and charm of the old internet, of everyone having their own little corner of the internet.

as this website develops i plan to turn it into a sort of hub for most of my online presence.
i am planning to regularly blog regarding multiple of my favourite subjects (most likely a combination of tech, rpgs and music). If i figure out how to i would even love to publish some of my rpg work and so on. really i hope this will become a catch all for my creative projects.
