## why make a website?
a personalised website goes a long way to distinguish yourself from others,
while bringing all your posts and projects together, and being able to build a community around that.

in the current internet landscape,
it seems that everyone just has 20 profiles scatted across different social media platforms
and in some part that is okay,
but i believe it has taken away from that old internet vibe and charm, of everyone having their own corner of the internet.

i am planning to regularly blog regarding multiple of my favourite subjects (most likely a combination of tech, rpgs and music).
